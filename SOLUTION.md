## Questions

This section contains additional questions your expected to answer before the debrief interview.

- **What is missing with your implementation to go to production?**

- **How would you deploy your implementation?**

- **If you had to implement the same application from scratch, what would you do differently?**

- **The application aims at storing hundreds of thousands listings and millions of prices, and be accessed by millions
  of users every month. What should be anticipated and done to handle it?**
